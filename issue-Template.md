### How to Create an Issue Template in GitHub

GitHub allows you to create **issue templates** to **standardize** bug reports, feature requests, or other issues.

**Steps to Create an Issue Template**
**1. Go to Your Repository**
**2. Navigate to the** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`** Directory** - If this folder doesn‚Äôt exist, create it inside the repository.
**3. Create a Markdown **(`.md`)** File for the Template** - Name the file descriptively, such as `bug_report.md` or `feature_request.md`.
**4. Define the Template Content**
**5. Commit and Push the Changes**

Alternatively, you can use GitHub's built-in interface:

- Go to **Settings ‚Üí Issues ‚Üí Set up templates ‚Üí Add template**

## Using Multiple Templates

If you have multiple templates, GitHub will allow users to choose a template when opening an issue.

For further customization, you can add an `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` file to define default issue labels, assignees, etc.

**Here‚Äôs a `config.yml `file in Markdown format explaining how to set it up:**

```yml
# .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml

blank_issues_enabled: false # Prevents users from creating blank issues
contact_links:
  - name: üí¨ Community Discussion
    url: https://github.com/YOUR-REPO/discussions
    about: Ask questions, request features, or discuss ideas here.
  - name: üìñ Documentation
    url: https://github.com/YOUR-REPO/wiki
    about: Check the documentation before opening an issue.
  - name: üöÄ Feature Requests
    url: https://github.com/YOUR-REPO/issues/new?template=feature_request.md
    about: Request a new feature or improvement.
  - name: üõ†Ô∏è Bug Reports
    url: https://github.com/YOUR-REPO/issues/new?template=bug_report.md
    about: Report a bug with detailed information.
```

### How to Use It?

**1. Create the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory** if it doesn't exist.
**2. Inside this directory**, create a `config.yml` file.
**3. Copy and paste** the above content into `config.yml`.
**4. Push the file to GitHub.**

### What Does This Do?

- ‚úÖ **Disables blank issues** (users must select a template).
- ‚úÖ **Provides alternative resources** (like discussions and documentation).
