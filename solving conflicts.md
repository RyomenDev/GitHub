# Resolving integration Issue B/W Local & remote

The error **"Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally"** occurs because the remote repository has new commits that you don‚Äôt have in your local repository. To resolve this, follow these steps:

### Solution: Pull First, Then Push

```sh
git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main
```

### Explanation

1. `git pull --rebase origin main `‚Üí Fetches the latest changes from the remote branch and applies your local changes on top.
2. `git push origin main` ‚Üí Pushes your changes after syncing with the remote.

### Alternative: Force Push (Use with Caution)

If you are sure that your local changes should overwrite the remote (not recommended unless necessary):

```sh
git push --force origin main
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This will overwrite the remote branch, potentially deleting others' work.

### Safer Alternative: Merge Instead of Rebase

If rebase causes conflicts, you can use:

```sh
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```

This will merge instead of rebasing.

Try the first solution `(pull --rebase)`
