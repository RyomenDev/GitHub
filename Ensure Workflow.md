### To ensure GitHub Actions workflow runs correctly, follow these steps:

---

## 🔹 Steps to Ensure Your Workflow Runs Successfully

---

### ✅ 1️⃣ Verify Workflow Configuration

- Ensure your workflow file is correctly named and located in:

    ```bash
    .github/workflows/ci-pipeline.yml
    ```

- The file should be in YAML format and properly indented.

---

### ✅ 2️⃣ Check Workflow Triggers

- Your workflow triggers on `push` and `pull_request`, so make sure you commit and push changes to trigger it:

    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Trigger CI pipeline"
    git push origin main
    ```

- If you want it to run manually, add this at the top of your file:
  ```yaml
  on:
    workflow_dispatch:
  ```

---

### ✅ 3️⃣ Ensure npm install and npm test Work Locally

- Run these commands locally before pushing to ensure no errors:

    ```sh
    npm install
    npm test
    npm run build
    ```

### ✅ 4️⃣ Check GitHub Actions Logs

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **"Actions"** tab.
3. Find your workflow run and check the logs for any errors.

### ✅ 5️⃣ Validate Secrets (If Needed)

- If using `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `DEPLOY_KEY`, ensure secrets are correctly set:
    1. Go to your repository.
    2. Navigate to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.
    3. Add `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `DEPLOY_KEY` if necessary.

### ✅ 6️⃣ Debug Errors in GitHub Actions

- If the workflow fails:
    - Click on the failed step in **GitHub Actions logs** to see the error message.
    - Use `echo` statements in the YAML file to debug, for example:
    ```yaml
    - name: Debug Environment
    run: echo "Running on $(uname -a)"
    ```

### ✅ 7️⃣ Force a Re-run

- To manually trigger the workflow again:
    - Go to the **Actions** tab → Click on the workflow → Click "Re-run jobs."

## 🚀 Final Checklist
✔️ `.github/workflows/ci-pipeline.yml` exists
✔️ GitHub Actions tab shows the workflow
✔️ `npm install` and `npm test` work locally
✔️ Secrets (if used) are set up correctly
✔️ GitHub Actions logs show no errors
