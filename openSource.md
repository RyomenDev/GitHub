## âœ… Step 1: Find a Project

1. Explore repositories on **[GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore)**.
2. Search for beginner-friendly issues using labels like:
   - `good first issue`
   - `help wanted`
   - `beginner friendly`
3. Check the project's README, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and open issues.

## âœ… Step 2: Fork the Repository

1. Go to the repository you want to contribute to.
2. Click the **"Fork"** button (top-right corner).
3. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

## âœ… Step 3: Clone the Repository

1. Copy the forked repositoryâ€™s URL.
2. Run this command in your terminal:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd REPO-NAME
   ```

## âœ… Step 4: Create a New Branch

1. Update your local repository:
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Create a feature branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```

## âœ… Step 5: Make Changes & Commit

1. Make the necessary changes to the code.
2. Add your changes:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```
3. Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Added feature X"
   ```

## âœ… Step 6: Push to Your Forked Repository

1. Push your changes to GitHub:
   ```sh
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```

---

## âœ… Step 7: Create a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to the original repository on GitHub.
2. Click **"Compare & pull request"** next to your feature branch.
3. Write a clear PR title and description explaining your changes.
4. Click **"Create pull request"**.

## âœ… Step 8: Respond to Reviews & Merge PR

1. Project maintainers may review and request changes.
2. Make the changes and push them again:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated feature X"
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```
3. Once approved, the maintainer merges your PR! ðŸŽ‰
